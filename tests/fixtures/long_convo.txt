ChatGPT:
    Hello! How can I assist you today?
user:
    Can you show me a simple `hello world` function in python?
ChatGPT:
    Certainly! Here's a simple `hello world` function in Python:
    
    ```
    def hello_world():
        print("Hello, world!")
    
    # Call the function
    hello_world()
    ```
    
    When you run this code, it will display `Hello, world!` in the console. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!
user:
    Can you help me write a regex that will capture and split each users response in a chat with the following format -

        ```
        def hello_world():
            print("Hello, world!")

ChatGPT:
    Certainly! Here's a regex pattern that can capture and split each user's response in a chat with the provided format:
    
    ```
    pattern = r"(?<=###)\n(.+?):\n(.+?)(?=\n.+?:|$)"
    ```
    
    Let's break down the regex pattern:
    - `(?<=###)` is a positive lookbehind assertion to match the `###` at the beginning of the chat.
    - `\n` matches a newline character.
    - `(.+?)` captures the username, matching one or more characters lazily.
    - `:` matches the colon character.
    - `\n` matches a newline character.
    - `(.+?)` captures the user's response, matching one or more characters lazily.
    - `(?=\n.+?:|$)` is a positive lookahead assertion to ensure that the next line either starts with a username or reaches the end of the chat.
    
    You can use this pattern with the `re.findall()` function in Python to find all the matches and split them into username-response pairs. Here's an example usage:
    
    ```python
    import re
    
    chat = """
    ###
    user:
        hello

        def hello_world():
            print("Hello, world!")
    
        # Call the function
        hello_world()
        ```
    
        When you run this code, it will display `Hello, world!` in the console. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!
    ###
    """
    
    pattern = r"(?<=###)\n(.+?):\n(.+?)(?=\n.+?:|$)"
    matches = re.findall(pattern, chat, re.DOTALL)
    
    for match in matches:
        username, response = match
        print(f"User: {username}")
        print(f"Response: {response}\n")
    ```
    
    This will output:
    
    ```
    User: user
    Response:     hello
